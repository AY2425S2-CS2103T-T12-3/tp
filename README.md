* This project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _REconnect_) used for providing Real Estate agents with an easier time for organizing contacts.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 10 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `REconnect` because it is a tool for Real Estate agents to connect with their clients.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[REconnect Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t12-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
