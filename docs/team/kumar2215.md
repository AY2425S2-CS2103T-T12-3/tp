### Project: REconnect

REconnect is a desktop application for Real Estate agents to manage their work by tracking the clients they work with, the events they have with them, the properties clients have an interest in and their ongoing deals. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Enabled autocompletion for all commands
  * What it does: Allows users to quickly find the command they want to use without having to remember the exact syntax.
  * Justification: This is especially useful for long commands with many parameters, as it saves time and reduces the chance of errors.
  * Highlights: It works by typing the first few letters of the command, choosing the command from the dropdown list, and pressing Enter to choose it. This works for command parameters as well.

* **New Feature**: Enabled navigation to previous commands.
  * What it does: Allows users to quickly navigate to previous commands using the up/down keys.
  * Justification: This is useful for users who want to quickly repeat previous commands without having to retype them.
  * Highlights: It works by pressing the up/down keys to navigate to previous commands, and pressing Enter to choose the command.

  * Created issue types, labels, and milestones for the project.
  * Ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.
  * In charge of defining, assigning, and tracking project tasks.
  * Looked after code quality, ensures adherence to good coding standards, e.g. SLAP.
