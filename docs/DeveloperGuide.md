## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `PropertyListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays the `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_client 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_client 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteClientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletClienteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the partial class diagrams in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserStructure.puml" width="600" height="500"/>
<puml src="diagrams/CommandStructure.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
  * All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800" height="600"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the data stored in REconnect i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### **Feature 1: Autocompletion of command names and prefixes**

This is done in 2 parts mainly:
- The `CommandBox` class is responsible for listening to changes to the user input and displaying the autocomplete suggestions based on that.
- The `LogicManager` class is responsible for providing the list of possible commands and prefixes to the `CommandBox`.

The `CommandBox` class listens to the user input and checks if the input matches any of the commands or prefixes. If it does, it displays the suggestions in a dropdown list. 
The user can then select one of the suggestions to autocomplete their command.

It has access to the command word to prefix mappings in the main `Command` class. However, since it's troublesome to main a hardcoded list of command words in the `Command` class, 
each concrete subclass of `Command` is responsible for adding its own command word and prefixes. This is done by implementing the `public static void addCommandWord()` method in 
each subclass.

Notice that the method is declared as static and public. This is because it is the `LogicManager` class that calls this method for all concrete command classes. It uses the Reflection 
API to find all concrete command classes and calls the `addCommandWord()` method on each of them during runtime before the Ui is loaded.

This is the implementation for running the `addCommandWord()` method in the `LogicManager` class:

```java
private void initialiseCommandWords() {
    Reflections reflections = new Reflections("seedu.address.logic.commands");
    Set<Class<? extends Command>> commandClasses = reflections.getSubTypesOf(Command.class);
    for (Class<? extends Command> commandClass : commandClasses) {
        boolean isAbstract = Modifier.isAbstract(commandClass.getModifiers());
        if (!isAbstract) {
            try {
                Method addCommandWord = commandClass.getDeclaredMethod("addCommandWord");
                boolean isStatic = Modifier.isStatic(addCommandWord.getModifiers());
                boolean isPublic = Modifier.isPublic(addCommandWord.getModifiers());
                if (isStatic && isPublic) {
                    addCommandWord.invoke(null);
                } else {
                    throw new RuntimeException(commandClass.getSimpleName()
                        + " does not have a public static addCommandWord method");
                }
            } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(commandClass.getSimpleName()
                    + " does not have a public static addCommandWord method", e);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                if (e instanceof RuntimeException) {
                    throw (RuntimeException) e;
                }
                logger.warning("Error invoking addCommandWord in " + commandClass.getSimpleName() + ": " + e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, its implemented in such a way that if any of the command classes do not implement the `addCommandWord()` method correctly, 
the app will throw a runtime exception and crash. This is to ensure that the command words are always in sync with the command classes.

### **Feature 2: Enabling the conjunction (AND) and disjunction (OR) of filtering parameters for find commands**

The find commands in the app allow users to search for clients, properties, deals and events using multiple parameters.
Instead of using either the conjunction or disjunction as the default for combining the parameters, we give the user the option to choose between the two.
That is to say, the user can choose to use either the conjunction or disjunction to combine the parameters but they must use 
the same type for all parameters except the first.

To enable this feature, we use a special `ConnectivePrefix` class to add this functionality. Connective prefixes are special prefixes 
that can be used to combine multiple parameters in a command. If a prefix can be connective (i.e. used in a find command), it can take 3 forms: 
its regular form (e.g. `after/`), its connective AND form (e.g. `AND_after/`) and its connective OR form (e.g. `OR_after/`).

The processing of the connective prefixes is done in the `abstract FindCommandParser` class.
Here is one such method that checks if the prefixes used in any of the find commands are valid:

```java
protected static void checkPrefixesUsedAreValid(List<Prefix> prefixesUsed) throws ParseException {
    List<Prefix> validPrefixes = prefixesUsed.stream()
        .filter(prefix -> !prefix.getPrefix().isEmpty())
        .toList();

    if (validPrefixes.isEmpty()) {
        throw new ParseException("No valid prefixes used");
    }

    Prefix firstPrefix = validPrefixes.get(0);
    if (firstPrefix.isConnective()) {
        throw new ParseException("First prefix used cannot be connective");
    }

    boolean allAnd = true;
    boolean allOr = true;
    for (int i = 1; i < validPrefixes.size(); i++) {
        Prefix currentPrefix = validPrefixes.get(i);
        if (!currentPrefix.isConnective()) {
            throw new ParseException("Subsequent prefixes used after the first must be connective");
        }
        if (currentPrefix.isAndPrefix()) {
            allOr = false;
        } else if (currentPrefix.isOrPrefix()) {
            allAnd = false;
        }
    }

    if (!allAnd && !allOr) {
        throw new ParseException("Cannot mix AND and OR connective prefixes");
    }
}
 ```

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Real Estate agents who 
* need to connect clients (e.g. buyers, sellers, investors) with the best opportunities based on market demands and property locations.
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Our product provides the user with easier real estate networking by having an organised contact log that can be managed faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app. Its intuitive design organises industry contacts and scheduling. Less time would be spent on such administrative tasks, and more could be spent on closing deals and strengthening their network.
